# Data Analytics Portfolio
This repository documents my learning journey in data analytics.  
It contains coursework, hands-on assignments, and small projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving.

My goal is to build a strong foundation in data analytics and gradually progress toward more advanced, end-to-end projects.
